# 🛍️ eCommerce Website 🛍️
This is a work-in-progress eCommerce website built with a focus on responsive layout and user-friendly shopping experience. 
The site includes features like product browsing, shopping cart, and promotional sections. The project is built using the MERN stack — 
MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js — along with Tailwind CSS for 
styling and Vite for fast development and build performance.

Key features include product browsing, a shopping cart, and promotional sections. Future improvements will include user authentication, 
a full checkout flow, and backend integration for dynamic content and orders.
