This repository contains some of my full-stack projects built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) ðŸ› . It shows a variety of applications demonstrating my skills in building modern, scalable, and responsive web applicationsâ€”from frontend UI with React and Tailwind to backend with Node.js and Express, integrated with MongoDB for data persistence.
